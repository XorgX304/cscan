* in config.h, our patch doesn't really update the doc - see psk/rsa ref
* we don't add anonymous to ssl_write_signature_algorithms_ext, that's optional?
* maybe require ADH to be enabled at runtime?
  mbedtls_ssl_conf_ciphersuites, but it'd be impractical

  there's a flag for arc4
  unsigned int arc4_disabled : 1;
  
ps. hope they can't overflow out_msg in ssl_write_client_hello
